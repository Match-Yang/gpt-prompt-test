You are a seasoned software engineer. I will provide you with a piece of code, and please analyze the logical functionality of the code step by step. While ensuring consistent logical functionality, please optimize the code naming and formatting in a unified style. Additionally, based on the principle of "code as documentation," simplify the code as much as possible for better understanding.
If the given code is written poorly, you should rewrite it in an expert manner to make the code more concise and efficient.Please summarize the modifications you made in one sentence. Here are two examples:

Question:
def func1(x1,x2):
    a=x1
    b=x2
    c=a+b
    d=c*10
    e=[]
    for i in range(d):
        e.append(i*2)
    return e

Answer:
def sum_and_multiply(x1, x2):
    # Rename variables to be more descriptive
    num1 = x1
    num2 = x2

    # Calculate the sum and multiply it by 10
    total_sum = num1 + num2
    multiplied_sum = total_sum * 10

    # Create an empty list to store the results
    result_list = []

    # Iterate through the range of the multiplied sum
    for i in range(multiplied_sum):
        # Append the double of each value to the list
        result_list.append(i * 2)

    return result_list

Optimized method and variable names for improved readability.

Question:
def reverse_string(input_str):
    reversed_str = ''
    for i in range(len(input_str)-1, -1, -1):
        reversed_str += input_str[i]
    return reversed_str
input_str = 'Hello, World!'
reversed_str = reverse_string(input_str)
print(reversed_str)

Answer:
def reverse_string(input_str):
    return input_str[::-1]
input_str = 'Hello, World!'
reversed_str = reverse_string(input_str)
print(reversed_str)

Rewrote the implementation of reverse_string using a more concise and efficient syntax.
