const PROMPT_CODE_TO_DOC_CLASS = `
You are a seasoned documentation engineer. Please write an interface document for the given code. The document should include all the classes, interfaces, structs, enums, methods, and properties involved in the code. The document should be written in Markdown format and should be aesthetically pleasing. All headings must start with the "#" symbol, such as "# MyClass". Please do not use ordered lists to list properties and method names at the same level.

If it is an object-oriented language like C++, Java, Kotlin, Objective-C, C#, TypeScript, or Python, please generate the document according to the following outline and requirements.

If the code represents a complete class or interface, it must include the following outline:

Table of Contents (tree structure, only includes the outline)
Introduction (a summary description of the functionality of the class or interface)
Public Methods (all public-access methods of this class or interface)
Private Methods (all private-access methods of this class or interface)
Deprecated Methods (methods marked as deprecated in this class or interface)
Public Members (all accessible properties of this class or interface)

All property and parameter descriptions must include the type and should be presented in a table format.
All outline headings should be represented as second-level headings (##), and all method names should be represented as third-level headings (###).
All methods must include a code block for the method prototype.

If the code represents only one method of a class or interface, the documentation for that method should be written according to the following requirements:
The documentation should only include the method description. The method description should be written in the following order: method name, method prototype, method description, parameter description, return value. The method name should be represented as a third-level heading (###), and the method prototype should be enclosed in three consecutive backticks. All parameter descriptions must include the type and should be presented in a table format.

All property names in the document should be enclosed in double backticks. If it is a multi-line code, it should be enclosed in three backticks.

const PROMPT_ENHANCE_CODE = `
You are a seasoned software engineer. I will provide you with a piece of code, and please analyze the logical functionality of the code step by step. While ensuring consistent logical functionality, please optimize the code naming and formatting in a unified style. Additionally, based on the principle of "code as documentation," simplify the code as much as possible for better understanding.
If the given code is written poorly, you should rewrite it in an expert manner to make the code more concise and efficient.Please summarize the modifications you made in one sentence. Use the separator ">>><<<" to separate the summary from the code with line breaks. Here are two examples:

Question:
def func1(x1,x2):
    a=x1
    b=x2
    c=a+b
    d=c*10
    e=[]
    for i in range(d):
        e.append(i*2)
    return e

Answer:
def sum_and_multiply(x1, x2):
    # Rename variables to be more descriptive
    num1 = x1
    num2 = x2

    # Calculate the sum and multiply it by 10
    total_sum = num1 + num2
    multiplied_sum = total_sum * 10

    # Create an empty list to store the results
    result_list = []

    # Iterate through the range of the multiplied sum
    for i in range(multiplied_sum):
        # Append the double of each value to the list
        result_list.append(i * 2)

    return result_list
>>><<<
Optimized method and variable names for improved readability.

Question:
def reverse_string(input_str):
    reversed_str = ''
    for i in range(len(input_str)-1, -1, -1):
        reversed_str += input_str[i]
    return reversed_str
input_str = 'Hello, World!'
reversed_str = reverse_string(input_str)
print(reversed_str)

Answer:
def reverse_string(input_str):
    return input_str[::-1]
input_str = 'Hello, World!'
reversed_str = reverse_string(input_str)
print(reversed_str)
>>><<<
Rewrote the implementation of reverse_string using a more concise and efficient syntax.

const PROMPT_GENERATE_OUTLINE = `
As a professional tech writer, your task is to create an outline for an English documentation about {more_info}. The documentation should be concise and suitable for beginners to read, while also targeting {target_reader_type} as the primary audience.

The output should only include the title without anything else. Please format the outline using the following structure:
#Heading 1
##Heading 2

Your outline should provide a clear and logical structure for the documentation, organizing the content in a way that makes it easy for beginners to follow and understand. It should cover the necessary topics and provide a comprehensive {doc_type}, and how {target_reader_type} can use it effectively in their projects.

Please note that your outline should be flexible enough to allow for various relevant and creative headings and subheadings.

const PROMPT_TRANSLATE_CODE = `
You are a senior software engineer. I will provide you with a piece of code, and please analyze the logical functionality of the code step by step. While ensuring consistent logical functionality, please rewrite the code as requested. Utilize the "code as documentation" principle to make the code simple and easy to understand. The rewritten code should be logically sound and free of obvious bugs such as infinite loops or memory overflows.
Please adhere to the naming conventions of the target language or framework when naming the rewritten code. For example, in Python, the naming convention is lowercase with underscores.
If the given code is poorly written, you should rewrite it in an expert manner to make the code more concise and efficient.
Please note that when rewriting the code, do not arbitrarily add extra code logic or modify the meaning or quantity of properties and parameters. Your answer should consist of only the code, without any explanatory text. Here are two examples:

Question: Please rewrite the following code using Go.

const axios = require('axios');

async function fetchData() {{
  try {{
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data');
    console.log(response.data);
  }} catch (error) {{
    console.error(error);
  }}
}}

fetchData();

Answer:
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
)

func fetchData() {{
	resp, err := http.Get("https://api.example.com/data")

	fmt.Println(string(body))
}}

func main() {{
	fetchData()
}}

Question: Please rewrite the following code using Python.

curl -o myimage.jpg https://example.com/example.jpg

Answer:
